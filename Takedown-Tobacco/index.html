    <h1 class = "text-center" style="color:green" "font-size: 40px">INTERVIEW WITH AN EXPERT</h1><br>
    <img src ="lui.jpg" height="300px" width="300px" ALIGN="right" HSPACE="25" VSPACE="25"/>We interviewed an expert in our field to get first person statistics and experience.<br></br>
    <h10> Question 1</h10><br>
    <p style= "color:white"><b> Q: Our topic is child tobacco usage and our first question is “We know smoking is bad, but can
you tell us what exactly happens when we smoke?” </b></p><br>
    <p style= "color:white">  A:So it causes a lot of damage to the lungs and the lining of the lungs. It has the compartments
within the lungs and they start breaking and that’s how it causes the damage. So that leads to
COPD. That is the first thing that it can lead to. In addition, smoking causes tons of cancers,
which doesn’t limit just to lungs, it causes a lot of cancers in the body.
</p>
    <br></br>
    <h10> Question 2</h10><br>
    <p style= "color:white"><b> Q:How is child tobacco use more dangerous and why? </b></p><br>
    <p style= "color:white">  A:It’s more dangerous, number one because your lungs are still very susceptible and very
naïve, and it is starting earlier. Smoking leads to more addictions. So people who start early will
end up smoking longer and so all the complications can start happening at a much earlier age.</p>

    <br></br>
    <h10> Question 3</h10><br>
    <p style= "color:white"><b> Q:Many people have the misconception that vaping isn’t bad for you. Can you explain how this
is untrue?</b></p><br>
    <p style= "color:white">  There are different kinds of vaping. Some of them have a filtered juice and some of them
have no filtered juice. So unfiltered juice is much more poisonous, that’s number one, and even
if it’s filtered, it has a pretty equivalent amount of nicotine to maybe a little less, depending on
the brand and there is no FDA control on that so it can be sometimes more than smoking. And
again, the kids who started vaping at an earlier age tend to lead to more addiction problems with
other drugs down the road. That’s how it actually can change your brain chemicals too.
</p>
<br></br>
    <h10> Question 4</h10><br>
    <p style= "color:white"><b> Q:How severe is the secondhand smoke to children’s health?</b></p><br>
    <p style= "color:white"> A:It’s pretty dangerous. There are kids who grew up before the new laws came about smoking.
Kids who grew up with parents smoking in the house, they have had a lot of cancers that
smokers have had. So it is as dangerous as smoking. Secondary - secondhand - smoking can
be as dangerous as primary smoking in some instances.
</p>
<br></br>
    <h10> Question 5</h10><br>
    <p style= "color:white"><b> Q:Do you see any correlation with mental health and the usage of these products among
teens?</b></p><br>
    <p style= "color:white"> A:Yes, because what happens is when you are getting addicted, it does change your brain
chemicals, and kids who have more anxiety and more depression and more stress, they tend to
look for a temporary resort to deal with their symptoms and they do find it does help temporarily
but on a long term it does make it worse, but they don’t know and so they get into the vicious
cycle and their symptoms can get worse.
</p>
<br></br>
    <h10> Question 6</h10><br>
    <p style= "color:white"><b> Q:Is this issue related to family income or lack of parental guidance?
teens?</b></p><br>
    <p style= "color:white"> A:Partly, yes and no. Family income, I would say no and parental guidance, to a certain extent
yes, to a certain extent no, it depends on the children. A lot of families where they’ve been
having open talk about these issues at the family dining table, kids tend to do less, but kids still
do it, so yes to answer but not completely one hundred percent full proof.
</p>
<br></br>
    <h10> Question 7</h10><br>
    <p style= "color:white"><b> Q:What about cigarettes makes it hard to quit?
teens?</b></p><br>
    <p style= "color:white"> A:So cigarettes are again a form of addiction and as any form of addiction worsens the brain
cells so it does alter, temporarily kids feel that they are feeling high or they are feeling - they’re
forgetting their anxiety issues or - it calms them temporarily, it has a short term impact. So in
short, that’s how it does it.
</p>
<br></br>
    <h10> Question 8</h10><br>
    <p style= "color:white"><b> Q:Do e-cigarettes have the same impact on the lungs as normal cigarettes?
teens?</b></p><br>
    <p style= "color:white"> A:Yes.
</p>
<br></br>
    <h10> Question 9</h10><br>
    <p style= "color:white"><b> Q:What about cigarettes makes it hard to quit?
teens?</b></p><br>
    <p style= "color:white"> A:So cigarettes are again a form of addiction and as any form of addiction worsens the brain
cells so it does alter, temporarily kids feel that they are feeling high or they are feeling - they’re
forgetting their anxiety issues or - it calms them temporarily, it has a short term impact. So in
short, that’s how it does it.
</p>
<br></br>
    <h10> Question 10</h10><br>
    <p style= "color:white"><b> Q: Why do people choose one over the other?</b></p><br>
    <p style= "color:white"> A:There is a big stigma about smoking cigarettes because of the fumes and everything.
E-cigarettes may not have [the fumes] because it comes in different flavors so people don’t get
as dejected, number one, people are not aware of the non-cigarette smoke. They don’t even
find out so kids end up doing that more too. So those are the main things and there is myth that
when people are trying to quit cigarette smoking they can do better with use of e-cigarettes to
curb their craving. So that’s another reason.
</p>

<br>
    <h10> Question 11</h10><br>
    <p style= "color:white"><b> Q: What is the appeal of vaping or using e-cigarettes?</b></p><br>
    <p style= "color:white"> A:I think it is a lot of peer pressure.
</p>

    <h10> Question 12</h10><br>
    <p style= "color:white"><b> Q: What incentives could we implement that would be effective to prevent kids from using
tobacco products?</b></p><br>
    <p style= "color:white"> A:Rewarding with non-financial, non-monetary options is what might work. Education -
incentivize is the only thing because if the incentive is monetary then it’s definitely going to get
worse.
